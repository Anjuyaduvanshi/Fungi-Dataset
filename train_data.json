The mycelium is made up of interwoven hyphae, forming a dense structure that absorbs nutrients. The mycelium can grow in various directions, including vertically, horizontally, and at angles, allowing the fungus to colonize a wide area. The mycelium can also produce specialized structures such as conidiophores.",
